## Bug Fix
As this is my first full-stack application, I had some confusion on how SPA can be connected to server. I first approached invalid method for SPA which is utlizing <b>Session</b> instead of <b>JWT</b>. Although I spent lots of time learning about invalid method, it provided me an opportunity to learned a lot about Cookies and Sessions.
